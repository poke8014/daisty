done
>Place bread in toaster and toast until golden brown.
>While bread is toasting, heat a large skillet over medium-high and spray with nonstick cooking spray. Cook eggs to preference (I like mine sunny side up but scrambled or over hard works too.)
Remove toast from toasted and spread ¼ of the avocado on each slice, using a knife to carefully press it into the bread like a spread. Sprinkle to taste with salt and pepper.
>Top each avocado toast with arugula, ham and an egg. Sprinkle again to taste with salt and pepper before serving.
