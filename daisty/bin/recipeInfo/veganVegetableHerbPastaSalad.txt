>Boil the pasta in a large pot of salted water. Cook according to the box instructions or al dente.
>While the pasta is boiling, prepare your salad dressing. Whisk together all of the ingredients in a medium bowl until combined. Set aside.
>Drain the pasta in a strainer and rinse under cold water until you don't feel any heat. I like to coat my cooked pasta with a drizzle of olive oil to keep it from sticking together. Transfer to a large mixing bowl.
>Add all vegetables to the pasta salad and pour the salad dressing over the salad. Toss all of the ingredients together until everything is coated evening. Season with extra salt and pepper if desired. Serve immediately or you can make this the day before.
