>Place butter into a microwavable mug and microwave until just melted. (roughly 20 seconds)
>Add in the remaining ingredients; mix well with a fork until just combined
>Once the batter is mixed place the spoonful of jam down into the batter to get a jammy center
>Microwave for 45 seconds or until it is firm on top. (Cooking time is based on my 1200W microwave so your timing might vary) Always keep a close eye on your mug while in the microwave so it doesnâ€™t overflow or overcook.
>Sprinkle some cinnamon sugar on top and enjoy straight away!
