done
>In a large mixing bowl, add flour of your choice
>Add vanilla, sugar, avocado oil, and soy milk (all at room temperature).
>Whisk vigorously until the crepe batter forms, with no lumps.
>Warm a non-stick crepe pan or non-stick pancake griddle under medium/high heat.
>Rub avocado oil onto the pan using a piece of absorbent paper.
>Scoop the batter onto the pan, then tip and rotate it to spread the batter as thinly as possible. Note that 1/2 cup of crepe batter perfectly covers a 28 cm (11 inches) crepe pan and makes a thin crepe.
>Brown 2-3 minutes on one side. You know it's ready to flip the crepe when the underside is getting crispy and unsticks by itself.
>Loosen sides with a flat tool and then slide a spatula under the crepe to flip on the other side.
>Cook for 1 more minute on the other side, then put on a plate and repeat this until no more batter left.
