done
>Dice the onion, pepper and tomato fairly small.
>Heat the oil in a skillet/frying pan or shallow pan over a medium heat and fry the onion for a couple minutes until softening.
>Add the pepper and cook another minute or two then add the tomato. Reduce the heat a little if sticking or drying out.
>Add the beans and mix through then add the eggs. Cook, stirring regularly, as if you are cooking scrambled eggs. Take off the heat just before they are fully cooked as they will continue to cook a bit after in the pan.
>Meanwhile warm the tortillas gently (in microwave, under grill or in a skillet/frying pan) - if you forget don't worry it's not the end of the world.
>Add the cheese and cilantro to the eggs and mix through then fill the two tortillas. Add any or all of your preferred toppings and serve immediately.
