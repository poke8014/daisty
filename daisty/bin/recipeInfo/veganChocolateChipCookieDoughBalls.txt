>1 cup raw cashews
>1 cup very tightly packed, soft pitted dates
>4 tbsp maca powder
>1 tsp pure vanilla extract
>1/2 tsp sea salt
>1/3 cup dairy-free chocolate chips
>1/4 tsp baking soda, optional
done
>Place the cashews in a high-powered blender or food processor and mix until broken down.
>A few larger chunks left behind is ok but they should resemble a coarse flour.
>Add the rest of the ingredients, except for the chocolate chips and mix until it forms a thick, sticky dough you can easily press together between your fingers.
>If it's not coming together, add 1 tsp warm water and process again.
>That should do the trick but you may need to repeat (this is due to using dry dates, see notes on soaking first).
>Add the chocolate chips and pulse a few times to mix through.
>Use your hands to roll the dough into 16 balls.
