done
>Preheat oven to 400°F (200°C).
>Brush both sides of bread with olive oil and place on a baking sheet. Sprinkle each slice of bread with about 2 tbsp (30 mL) cheese. Bake for 10 minutes, then flip slices cheese side down and bake until bread is crispy and golden, about 5 minutes more.
>In a large non-stick frying pan, heat butter. Add shallots and cook for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add mushrooms and garlic and cook until softened, 4 to 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. Stir in spinach, parsley, and 1/4 tsp (1 mL) each salt and pepper. Cook for a minute until spinach has wilted. Remove mixture from pan and keep it warm.
>Heat any remaining oil in the same frying pan. Cook eggs until the whites are set and the yolks are cooked as desired. (A runny yolk makes a delicious “sauce” for this dish, but cook the yolks as you prefer.)
>Place toast on serving plates, cheese side up. Spoon mushroom and spinach mixture over cheese, then add fried eggs on top. Sprinkle with pepper, to taste.
