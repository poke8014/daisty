done
>Pre-heat oven to 220 F. 
>Core the apples if you have an apple corer.
>If not, go ahead and slice them into thin, even rounds using a sharp knife or mandolin slicer, removing any seeds as you go.
>If using a knife, try to get them as thin and even as possible.
>For best results, aim for consistent slices so they bake evenly.
>Place the slices in a bowl and sprinkle with cinnamon.
>Use 1/2-1 tsp to start, depending on how many apples you used, mix then add more if needed.
>Use your hands to mix so that each apple slice is coated.
>If you prefer, you can arrange them on the baking sheet and then sprinkle with cinnamon or mix in a bowl so they’re thoroughly and evenly coated on both sides.
>Optionally, you can skip this step and bake them without cinnamon.
>They’re delicious just like that too!
>Arrange the apple slices in a single layer on a silicone mat or parchment paper-lined baking sheet.
>Bake for 1 hour then remove from the oven and flip.
>Bake for another hour then turn the oven off and leave them in the oven until completely cooled.
