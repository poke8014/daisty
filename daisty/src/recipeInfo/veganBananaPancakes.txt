>First, prepare your flax eggs by mixing together 2 tablespoons of ground flax seeds and 6 tablespoons of warm water. Let sit for 15 minutes.
>Next, mix together dry ingredients in a medium-size bowl and set aside.
>In a large bowl, mash banana until liquidy. Then, once your flax eggs are slimy/gummy, add those to the large bowl and mix. Add in the rest of the wet ingredients other than the coconut oil and mix well.
>Slowly add dry ingredients to wet and mix.
>Finally add in melted coconut oil and mix until smooth. As your batter sits it may thicken, so add extra almond milk as needed.
>Preheat a large frying pan to low/medium heat and spray with coconut oil cooking spray.
>Scoop a heaping 1/3 cup of the batter onto your pan and cook for 3-5 minutes on each side or until golden brown and fully cooked.
