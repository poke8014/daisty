done
>Remove the bones from the chicken thighs.
>Place the chicken, chopped tomatoes, olive oil and minced garlic in a non-stick pan and cook at medium-high for 3-4 minutes until it starts looking like a tomato sauce.
>Add a little bit of water (about 1/4 cup), some tomato paste, pinch some salt, stir in the macaroni (I used a brand that cooks in 3 minutes) and dill. The macaroni should be just covered, but not drowning in the sauce to cook properly.
>Cook until the macaroni is ready, then stir in the mozzarella.
>Let the mozzarella melt, making a cheesy tomato sauce.
>Serve immediately!
