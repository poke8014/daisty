>Prepare 1 serving of my Favorite Guacamole Recipe.
>Lightly brush the tortillas with olive oil. Fill the quesadillas by placing 1 cup of guacamole in the tortilla. With the back of a spoon, spread the guacamole out towards the side of the tortilla wrap (see photo). Evenly sprinkle Â½ cup of the shredded carrots on top. Toss a small handful of chopped cilantro and green onion on top with a few shakes of hot sauce. Place the second tortilla wrap on top.
>On medium heat, in a non-stick skillet, transfer the quesadilla to the pan. Cook on each side for 2-3 minutes (carefully flipping the quesadilla so it doesn't fall apart!) until warm on the inside and nice and crispy on the outside.
>Cook second quesadilla the same way (you will have a bit of guacamole left over).
>Cut into quarters. Garnish with chopped cilantro and green onion and serve with remaining guacamole.
