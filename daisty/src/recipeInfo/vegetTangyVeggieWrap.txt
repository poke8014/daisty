done
>Roast the sunflower seeds in a pan without any oil/fat until golden brown.
>Peel and grate the carrots. Wash and dice the the bell pepper (get rid of the seeds and white bits).
>Peel the onion and cut in thin rings. Wash and drain the spinach. Wash the bean sprouts with cold water and let them dry.
>Peel the ginger and grate it into a bowl. Add the cottage cheese, sour cream (or your vegan substitute), lemon zest and mustard and mix it well.
>Spread the dressing mixture onto the wraps, stopping about 1cm from the edge. Lay out the spinach leaves on top.
>Put the carrots, bell pepper, onions and bean sprouts in a wide line down the middle and sprinkle the roasted sunflower seeds on top.
>Season with a dash of salt and pepper and fold the wraps a little on both sides, then at the bottom and roll it as tightly as possible (without squishing the insides out!).
>Cut the wraps into halves and serve. Enjoy!
