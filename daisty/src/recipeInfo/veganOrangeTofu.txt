>In a medium saucepan, combine 1 cup water, orange juice, vinegar, soy sauce, sugar, red pepper flakes, ginger, garlic, and lemon juice and bring the mixture to a boil. Stir constantly.
>While the liquid is cooking, combine cornstarch/arrowroot and 1/2 a cup of water. Add the mixture to the pot and cook on medium-low heat until the orange sauce is thick. This usually takes about 3-5 minutes. Remove from heat as soon as the sauce thickens!
>Using a plate or shallow dish, add flour, salt, and pepper.
>Drain your tofu and press it between a dishcloth to remove some of the liquid. Cut your tofu into 1-inch squares.
>Using clean dry hands, mix your tofu with the flour mixture. Using your hands prevents the tofu from falling apart. If you use a spoon, the tofu may not keep its shape.
>In a large frying pan, heat 2-4 tablespoon of oil. Add tofu and cook on medium-high heat until golden brown. Your tofu will crisp up nicely! Make sure that all sides of the tofu get cooked and gently turn during the frying process. This usually takes about 5 minutes.
>Remove frying pan from the heat and stir in orange sauce with the tofu. Mix to combine so that every piece of tofu is coated. You can do this on low heat too!
>Serve on white rice topped with chopped green onions and sesame seeds!
