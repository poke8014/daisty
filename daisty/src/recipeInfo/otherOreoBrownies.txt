>Preheat the oven to 325. Prepare the brownie mix as directed with the egg, oil and water.
>Coarsely crush the Oreos in a large bag with your hands or a rolling pin.
>Leave some pieces pretty big for texture. Pour them into the batter and mix well.
>Batter will be thick.
>Pour batter into a greased square baking pan (about 8Ã—8) and bake for 30-40 minutes.
>Check doneness by inserting a knife into the brownies; if it comes out mostly clean, you should be good to go.
>But when in doubt, underbake!
