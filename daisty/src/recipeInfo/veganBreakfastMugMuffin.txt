>2 tablespoons non-dairy milk, such as unsweetened almond or oat milk

>⅓ cup fine oat flour (34 grams)
>½ teaspoon pumpkin spice blend or cinnamon
>½ teaspoon baking powder
>pinch of sea salt
done
>In a standard, 10-ounce, microwave-safe mug (a larger mug is fine, too), combine the nut butter, milk, maple syrup, and vanilla. Stir well so that the nut butter is fully incorporated.
>In a separate mug, stir together the oat flour, baking powder, salt, and pumpkin spice or cinnamon. Pour the dry ingredients into the mug with the wet ingredients, and stir until there's no visible dry flour.
>Microwave ovens vary, so stay nearby and keep an eye on the mug the first time you try the recipe. Begin by microwaving on high power for 50 seconds. Then microwave for another 10 to 20 seconds, depending on how much the cake has risen and whether the center appears firm.
>Let sit 5 minutes, then enjoy! For breakfast it's delicious with plain vegan yogurt and a sprinkle of hemp seeds. Or if enjoying as a dessert, try it with your favorite vegan ice cream, dairy-free whipped cream, and/or maple syrup.
