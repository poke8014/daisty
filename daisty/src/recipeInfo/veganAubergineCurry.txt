>1 tsp garam masala powder or curry powder
>1 tsp turmeric
>1 tsp ground coriander

>½ tsp salt
>½ tsp pepper
done
>Cook rice according to packet instructions.
>Cut the aubergine into small cubes. Fry in a large pan with the olive oil on high heat for 3-4 minutes. Stir well so it doesn’t burn.
>In the meantime dice the onion and throw it in too. Put it back to a medium heat and cook for 5-6 minutes.
>Crush or dice the garlic.
>Stir in the garlic, garam masala, turmeric and ground coriander. Cook for another 3-4 minutes, stirring well.
>Pour in the chopped tomatoes and coconut milk. Add salt. Simmer for about 15 minutes. The coconut milk thickens so stop cooking when it is at the right consistency for you. Stir in the sugar or mango chutney if you like it a little sweeter.
>Serve with salt and pepper to taste.
