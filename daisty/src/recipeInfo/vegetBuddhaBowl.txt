>Gather the ingredients.
>Add the cubed tofu onto a paper towel-lined baking sheet. Add another paper towel on top of the tofu and weigh it down with another pan to remove as much of the liquid as possible. Leave weighed down for about 10 minutes. Add salt and pepper.
>Heat up a large saute pan and add the canola oil. Fry the tofu on medium-high heat, turning to brown on at least two sides. Remove from the pan and set aside.
>Gather the ingredients for the dressing.
>Blend all of the dressing ingredients in a blender or food processor until completely smooth. Add a tablespoon of water and blend again until smooth and creamy.
>Mix a 1/4 cup of the dressing into the cooked quinoa.
>Divide the quinoa among four bowls. Top with the crispy tofu, carrots, cabbage, cucumbers, bean sprouts, scallions, and crushed peanuts.
>Drizzle the extra dressing over the bowls to your taste. Garnish with lime wedges and cilantro. Serve immediately.
